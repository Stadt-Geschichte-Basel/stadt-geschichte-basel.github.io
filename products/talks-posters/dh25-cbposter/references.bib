	abstract = {This session explores the critical challenge of digital longevity in the field of digital history, with a focus on the public history project Stadt.Geschichte.Basel. It highlights the Endings Project at the University of Victoria, which proposes a comprehensive framework of principles to ensure the sustainability of digital projects. These principles emphasize the importance of open data formats, detailed documentation, rigorous editing, user-centric product design without server-side dependencies, and a strategic release management protocol to mitigate the risks associated with a potential "digital dark age". The Stadt.Geschichte.Basel project exemplifies the application of these principles and demonstrates how a publicly funded digital history initiative can achieve long-term preservation and openness. The project emphasizes the need for ongoing stakeholder engagement, interdisciplinary collaboration, and the application of user-centered design for inclusive and effective user participation. It emphasizes the importance of iterative refinement in the development process to address the technical and organizational complexities inherent in multi-stakeholder settings. By extracting best practices from the Stadt.Geschichte.Basel experience, this session contributes to the discourse on project management in digital history and serves as a guide for creating resilient, user-centered, and sustainably managed digital resources.},

	abstract = {This manual is a guide to creating non-discriminatory metadata for historical sources and research data, developed as part of the Stadt.Geschichte.Basel research project. It is aimed at professional historians, archivists, librarians and anyone involved in open research data in the field of history. The authors Moritz Mähr and Noëlle Schnegg guide readers through the practical aspects of creating metadata based on the FAIR principles to make research data discoverable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. Through practical instructions and illustrated case studies, the manual shows how machine-readable metadata can enrich research and teaching and influence the interpretation of historical sources. As a publicly accessible "living document", it is designed for continuous development by the community and is committed to an inclusive and non-discriminatory representation of historical content. The handbook is a fundamental resource for anyone interested in modern digital history and open research data. It is available in German.},

Moritz Mähr (Digital Lead) about CollectionBuilder and its use case in the project Stadt.Geschichte.Basel.The Problem with Public History: Even if you want to share your digital story and your data, as a researcher you typically don't have the money to use a paid service, the infrastructure for a self-hosted open source solution like Omeka, and the time or technical skills to code it yourself. The Solution: With CollectionBuilder, you can host digital collections, exhibits, and stories, by yourself (with very little technical skill), sustainable (open source, long time archivable), and free of charge. It has an extensive documentation and a very supportive open source community.},

	abstract = {A comprehensive history of the city of Basel has been underway at the University of Basel since 2018. More than 70 authors are investigating the past 2200 years and writing 10 volumes for it. In 2017, the Stadt.Geschichte.Basel Foundation, which is carrying out the project, made a commitment to the canton of Basel-Stadt to make the research data available to the public via an online portal. We interpret this commitment as meaning that the research data will be collected, processed and secured for later use and long-term archiving in a first step, before being made available to the general public in a second step. This raises the question - and this is a general problem in historical research - of what research data are and, following on from this, how they can be made accessible. A field report.},
