	abstract = {The internet is a prime means for distributing and visualising spatial data from cartographic and geographic databases. Reaching a broad audience, the number of maps designed and distributed on the World Wide Web has increased dramatically since the mid-1990s. From an original scientific niche, internet-based technology has grown to almost universal application in many practical contexts.In line with demands for fast access to information and rapid transfer of spatial data, internet-based maps are now delivered to the user in a fraction of the time required to distribute print maps. A wide range of distribution instruments exists, including raw data servers (e.g. DEM), maps on demand (Internet Map Servers), interactive image maps, Web-GIS, animated maps and 3D-maps (virtual reality). A growing industry is involved in developing software specifically for distribution and retrieval of spatial (geographic) data. The process of data distribution via the internet is characterized by increasing commercialization and professionalism, leading to the development of very user-friendly systems that are used by a growing range of enterprises and organisations. Multimedia components now widely accompany standard map generation, meeting the user's growing multimedia orientation and opening new ways of sharing spatial information. In contrast to non-digital maps, ordinary HTML-page Internet Map Servers are characterized by a wide range of techniques and interactive features which make information more individual and specific. Therefore, such servers offer interesting perspectives for digital cartography in the context of presentation and exploration of spatial data.In practice, both print and internet-based maps are now equally well used. But how good are internet-based maps? Are they more effective than conventional print maps or just a pretty technological toy? Adequate transmission of information requires two features. First of all, information must be transmitted completely and correctly (effectiveness). But secondly, the result must be seen in relation to the amount of time required to achieve full and correct information (efficiency). To estimate the potential added value of the new technology, the effectiveness of web maps (interactive and animated maps) needs to be compared to that of print maps. This study describes a first attempt at experimentally assessing the effectiveness of information transmission for both map types.The experiment analysed patterns of map use in 84 first-term geography students of Göttingen University. The students were split into two equally sized groups, dealing with one type of map respectively. Their task was to respond to a list of questions, which aimed to establish how well topographical and land use information could be extracted from each type of map. In order to be comparable, questions were identical for the conventional map and the online version. This also enabled an estimate of the time required for assimilating and processing information. Results indicate a general difference in perceptive behaviour of both sample groups, although the differences between the two forms of visualisation are not always readily apparent. Of particular interest for evaluating the success of map-based online information transfer was the proportion of correct answers. In six out of nine questions, the interactive web map yielded more correct answers than the conventional map. The average proportion of correct answers was about 76\% for web maps compared to 61\% for print maps, indicating a higher effectiveness of map-based online systems. Although the study was unable to include all forms of cartographic presentations available on the World Wide Web, results indicate that spatial information is more effectively transmitted by internet-based maps as part of an integrated visualisation system than classic printed maps.},

	abstract = {Scientific work is heterogeneous, requiring many different actors and viewpoints. It also requires cooperation. The two create tension between divergent viewpoints and the need for generalizable findings. We present a model of how one group of actors managed this tension. It draws on the work of amateurs, professionals, administrators and others connected to the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology at the University of California, Berkeley, during its early years. Extending the Latour-Callon model of interessement, two major activities are central for translating between viewpoints: standardization of methods, and the development of `boundary objects'. Boundary objects are both adaptable to different viewpoints and robust enough to maintain identity across them. We distinguish four types of boundary objects: repositories, ideal types, coincident boundaries and standardized forms.},
